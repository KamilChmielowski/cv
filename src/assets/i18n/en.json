My strongest point is Angular framework but I have also some experience with different programming languages and tools. I am interested both in frontend and backend development.</p><p>As Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux kernel and Git system version control, said: „Talk is cheap. Show me the code”, so be sure to check my <a href=\"https://github.com/KamilChmielowski/\" target=\"_blank\">github account</a> where I have developed some sample web applications to proof my profession.</p><p>My interests include non-fiction and popular science literature, ancient Greek and biblical exegesis. I am also an author of extensive web platform <a href=\"https://apologetykabiblijna.pl\" target=\"_blank\">apologetykabiblijna.pl</a>, built and deployed on my own from scratch with popular MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node).</p>",
